The specification for /Two Dots/ consists of ~Controller~, the main controller in the CV, ~View~, the module responsible for the view, ~BoardT~, the module holding the board information, ~GameState~ interface, the interface responsible for the win and lose conditions, and the three implementing modules of ~GameState~.

The game is a 2 dimensional board which consists of coloured dots. The main action of the game is to connect at least two adjacent dots, not diagonally. Connecting dots consumes them, lowering the above dots to fill the gap then populates the empty top spots with new random dots. The win and lose conditions are defined by the game type.

There are three specified game types:

- Timer:
  - Gives the player a timer until the game is finished. The player aims to achieve the highest score during the time by connecting dot.
- Score:
  - The player tries to achieve a set score. When achieved the game ends and the player "wins"
- Moves:
  - The player has a limited number of moves before the game is over. During which he have to score a set score else he loses.
